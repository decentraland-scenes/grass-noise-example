# grass-noise-example

Using the Noise Utils library to simulate random grass movement from wind

This scene uses the [noise utils](https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-noise-utils) library to generate a semi-random sequence that uses a 3d version of the _Simplex_ formula to change the rotation of grass over time.

The first two dimensions of the Simplex formula are mapped to the x and z coordinate of each grass entity, the thrid dimension of the Simplex formula is iterated over time to create movement.

The grass movement is random, but follows a smooth series of transitions that appear to move close grass entities together. The movement patterns are deterministic, but start from a random seed and don't have clear recognizeable repeating patterns.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

Download this example and navigate to its directory, then run:

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

**Scene Usage**

Click on the grass to start the movement. Each grass clump moves independently, following its own values from the Simplex random noise algorithm.
